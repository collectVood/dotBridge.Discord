## Code of Conduct

This community, contributors, maintainers and everyone participating in the project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Before contributing you must read the [Contribution License Agreement](CLA.md).

## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

You are able to report bugs using Issues section in case you found a bug.\
First of all, make sure it wasn't reported before and the issue is open.

To create a good and friendly bug reports you may:

* Use a **descriptive and clear title**
* Describe exactly step-by-step **how can we reproduce the issue**
* Explain which **behaviour you expected** and why
* In case you have an idea, suggest **how we may be able to fix it**

Keep being polite :wink:

### Suggesting enhancements

Everyone can suggest an enhancement, including minor improvements and completely new features using Issues section.

To create a good and friendly suggestion you may:

* Use a **descriptive and clear title**
* Provide some **examples** or **concepts**
* Explain **why this enhancement would be useful**
* List some other projects, **where it already exists**

Keep being cool :sunglasses:

### Code contribution

You can contribute to our code using Pull Requests section.

How to use and create Pull Requests?

* Create a **fork** of the repo
* Make sure you have two **remotes**: **origin** (fork) and **upstream** (our repository)
* **Improve** the code :chart_with_upwards_trend:
* **Commit** your changes to the **needed branch**
* Create a **Pull Request**
* Specify a **descriptive and clear** title

Also, do not forged to follow the [styleguides](#styleguides) :wink:

How to update my fork and keep local changes?

**A. Uncommitted**

* Use **git stash** to save your changes
* Run **git pull upstream (branch, e.g. develop)** to update your fork with latest changes
* Get your changes back by using **git stash pop**. If there are any conflicts, open Google

**B. Committed**

* Use **git merge** (see [documentation](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-merge))

If someone requested some changes and the request was refused, no need to be impolite or give up.\
You can still do something for this world and improve the code once more. But next time make sure that everything is good enough to be merged (accepted).

## Styleguides

### Git commit messages

* Use the present tense (**"Add feature"**, not **"Added feature"**)
* Use an imperative mood (**"Move cursor to.."**, not **"Moves cursor to.."**)
* Make first commit line as **small, descriptive and clear**, as possible
* Do not reference issues or pull requests in the first commit line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` - Improving **format, structure, etc**
    * :memo: `:memo:` - Writing **documentation, contributing, etc** files
    * :pencil2: `:pencil2:` - **Minor** changes
    * :fire: `:fire:` - Important **bug, etc fix**
    * :zap: `:zap:` - Improving **performance**
    * :lock: `:lock:` - Dealing with **security**
    * :cookie: `:cookie:` - Adding **new features and code**

### Code styling

* Always specify [**access modifiers**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers)
* Provide **less access** to the [members](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/members) that may be accessed only inside the project
* Provide [**XML documentation** comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/)
* In case you use **abbreviations** up to 3 letters inclusively, use the **upper-case**

### XML documentation comments

* Use the present tense (**"Get data"**, not **"Will get data"**)
* Use an imperative mood (**"Set data"**, not **"Sets data"**)
* Make comment as **small, descriptive and clear**, as possible
* Use [**tags**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments)
